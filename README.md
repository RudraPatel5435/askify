# The Fourier Integral

## Introduction

The Fourier Integral is an extension of Fourier series to *non-periodic* functions.  While Fourier series represent periodic functions as a sum of sines and cosines, the Fourier Integral represents non-periodic functions as an *integral* of sines and cosines. This is necessary because periodic functions have a discrete set of frequencies they oscillate at, while non-periodic functions can oscillate at any frequency, necessitating an integral over a continuous range of frequencies.

## Motivation

*   **Fourier Series Limitation:** Fourier series only apply to periodic functions. Many signals and functions in the real world are not periodic (e.g., a single pulse).
*   **Extending Period to Infinity:**  The intuitive idea behind the Fourier integral is to imagine a periodic function whose period approaches infinity. As the period gets larger, the fundamental frequency gets smaller, and the discrete frequencies in the Fourier series become more and more closely spaced. In the limit, they become a continuous spectrum of frequencies, leading to an integral.
